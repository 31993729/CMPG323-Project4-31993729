## Project 4 
Started the project but have not commited anything cause its not in a functioning order

## How it works
1. Start by running the UIpath Main.xaml. 
2. The flowchart will run a login and add the username and password automaticaly.
3. After the login has run the program will start with the Zone and start adding the data from the excel sheet "Zones" and then change the excel sheet "Test Results"
and change the status of Read and Create table to true if it was read and added succesfully 
4. The previous process will be repeated for the excel sheet "Category" and after Category "Device" and the sheet "Test result" will also be updated for both sheets completion if so

## Problems
Update and Delete was not added cause I did not know how to implement it I got confussed and tried allot of diffrent none looked like the correct way so i deleted it cause i don't know how to comment out code
